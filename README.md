## A leaderboard for players and their board game scores

### Purpose

During lunch breaks and happy hours, my coding class played a lot of board games.  This application was built to keep track of who had won which games the most times, and what their scores were.

### Notes

This was a class project where back end students were to collaborate with front end students in a very short time, with back and front end work being done in separate repositories.  This repo contains only the back end portion of the project, and some aspects have not been fully fleshed out.  The code here can store a game type, players, a winner, and a loser for each game played, as well as basic information about players.  It can generate json data for each game and player.
